#Problems:

Needed to figure out how to read the midi events being output by the python3-midi library

We eventually figured out that the NoteOnEvent has a tick value that indicates the time since the last note ended. The NoteOffEvent also has a tick but it represents how long the current note has been played.

Data[0] is the note being played.

We had to write down the frequency of every single note on the piano.

we forgot to convert numbers to words (int to string)

#Big Problem

python-midi has next to no documentation, meaning I basically know nothing about how to use the code.
